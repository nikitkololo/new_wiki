# Custom Organization list

COL - Add-on for partner that restricts free registration of organizations on that partner. 
The logic is that if the COL is enabled, then Users can't create and register Organizations. In partner's AddOrganization, the Admins partner can add Organizations in the Organizations tab of his / her Admin. 

## Example:
Open Partner Admin - Organization tab.
Press the button Avtions.
Select the Add Org item.
A modal opens in which you enter the name and address of the organization.
Press Save and Close.

In another browser, go to the Partner /start.
We register a new user.
At the "Who are you fundraising for?" step, enter the name of the created org.
In the drop-down menu from the list of organizations, find yours. 
Click on it.
Click Start Fundraising.
Done, the organization is registered.
